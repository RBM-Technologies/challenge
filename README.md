Coding challenges for engineering roles

If you are applying for a senior level role, please use the coding challenge in the senior folder.

If you are applying for a mid-level or junior role, please use the coding challenge in the mid-and-jr folder.

For both challenges, the .txt file describes everything you need to know.  The json file is the test data you your solution will process.

Good luck!
